      <p class="p-justify text-indent">Someone asked if it was possible to add checkboxes at the bottom of Zendesk Help Center Community comment editor so moderators could mark a Community Post as "Answered" or "Closed for comments" at the same time they posted a reply.</p>
      <p class="p-justify text-indent">This can be done by using JavaScript to add the chekboxes and make API calls to update the post.</p>
      <p class="p-justify text-indent">Quick note before starting: This is customization that is not supported by Zendesk, and you might need a web developer to help you if you have issues.</p>
      <p class="p-justify text-indent">Go to your Zendesk Help Center's Edit Theme page and add <a href="https://github.com/aculligan/Zendesk_Help_Center_Community_Moderator_Controls/blob/master/script.js" target="_blank">this</a> code at the top of the JS page.</p>
      <p class="p-justify text-indent">Save and publish the changes, and that's it.</p>
